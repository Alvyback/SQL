/* In this SQL Code, I'm querying a database that contains a list of American cities to answer questions about the database.

1. Query all columns for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 100000. The CountryCode for America is USA.

SELECT * FROM CITY
WHERE COUNTRYCODE = 'USA'
AND POPULATION > 100000;

2.Query the NAME field for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 120000. The CountryCode for America is USA.

SELECT NAME FROM CITY
WHERE COUNTRYCODE = 'USA' AND POPULATION > 120000;

3. Query all columns (attributes) for every row in the CITY table.

SELECT * FROM CITY;

4. Query all columns for a city in CITY with the ID 1661.

SELECT * FROM CITY

WHERE ID = 1661;

5. Query all columns for all Japanese cities in the CITY table. The CountryCode for Japan is JPN.

SELECT * FROM CITY
WHERE COUNTRYCODE = 'JPN'

6. Query a list of CITY and STATE from the STATION table.

SELECT CITY,STATE 
FROM STATION

7. Query a list of CITY names from STATION for cities that have an even ID number. Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer.

 SELECT distinct city 
 from station where mod (ID,2) = 0; or FROM Station WHERE ID % 2 = 0; 

8.Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.

SELECT (COUNT(city)) - (COUNT(DISTINCT city)) 
FROM station;

9. Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY), CITY LIMIT 1; - longest 

SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY LIMIT 1; - shortest 

10. Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
where LEFT(CITY, 1) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');

11. Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
where Right(CITY, 1) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');

12. Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION WHERE LEFT(CITY,1) IN ('a','e','i','o','u') 
AND RIGHT(CITY,1) IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

13. Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE LEFT(CITY,1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

14. Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE RIGHT(CITY,1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

15.Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT(CITY) 
FROM STATION 
WHERE RIGHT(CITY,1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u') 
OR LEFT(CITY,1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

16. Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels and do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT(CITY) FROM STATION 
WHERE RIGHT(CITY,1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u') 
AND LEFT(CITY,1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u');
