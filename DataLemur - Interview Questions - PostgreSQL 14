2. Tesla is investigating bottlenecks in their production, and they need your help to extract the relevant data. Write a SQL query that determines which parts have begun the assembly process but are not yet finished.

SELECT part

WHERE finish_date IS NULL
GROUP BY part;

3.Assume that you are given the table below containing information on viewership by device type (where the three types are laptop, tablet, and phone). Define “mobile” as the sum of tablet and phone viewership numbers. Write a query to compare the viewership on laptops versus mobile devices.

Output the total viewership for laptop and mobile devices in the format of "laptop_views" and "mobile_views".

SELECT 
  SUM(CASE WHEN device_type = 'laptop' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS laptop_views, 
  SUM(CASE WHEN device_type IN ('tablet', 'phone') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS mobile_views 
FROM viewership;
